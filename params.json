  "body": "### Welcome to Micro Movinghead Project\r\nThe Micro Movinghead project is a project that combines Arduino coding, PCB, simple electronics and 3D printed parts to make a simple DMX controlled Movinghead which is as small as possible and therefor cheap.\r\n\r\n### Design goals\r\nThis project has 2 main goals, first the final design should be a complete package and secondly the Movinghead should be as small a possible.\r\n\r\n### Spin-offs\r\nThis project also gives a framework on which different opensource lighting can be designed, for instance larger movingheads, scans, colorchangers. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe first version was made by Frederik (@frederikkoopman)\r\n\r\n",
